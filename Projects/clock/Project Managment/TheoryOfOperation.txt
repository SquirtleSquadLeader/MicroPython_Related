Theory of operation

The Raspberry Pi Pico W will initialize the DS3231 breakout, via I2C, and set 
the local time.  Via SPI, the Pico W will display that time by updating the TFT display.  
An alarm will be able to be programmed by the user (initially hardcoded in - physical buttons to 
follow).  When the clock goes into an alarm state, the Pico will communicate
via I2S to the audio amplifier.  This will drive the speaker to make some kind of noise.
This may require releasing the I2C bus so that the I2S can operate
without losing the display (RESEARCH/TESTING REQ'D).  After the alarm state 
ends the device will return to normal operation and display time. Data 
can be stored on the microSD card of the TFT display.  This leaves room
for expansion of the visual system and other settings/configurations.
